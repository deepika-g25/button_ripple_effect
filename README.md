ðŸŒŠ Button Ripple Effect â€“ Day 7 of 75 Days of Frontend Challenge

This project is part of my 75 Days of Frontend Challenge, where I build daily mini-projects to sharpen my web development skills.
On Day 7, I focused on creating a Button Ripple Effect using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” a small interaction that adds a big touch of interactivity and delight to the user experience.

Overview

The Button Ripple Effect is a clean micro-interaction that visually responds to user clicks. The ripple animation originates from the click position and fades out gracefully â€” built entirely without any external libraries.

Tech Stack

HTML â€“ Structure of the button
CSS â€“ Styling and ripple animation using ::before pseudo-element
JavaScript â€“ Tracks cursor position and updates CSS variables dynamically

What I Learned

How to animate elements using ::before
Creating ripple effects with CSS variables (--xPos, --yPos)
Enhancing user interfaces with small, elegant animations
Building fluid UI feedback without relying on libraries or frameworks

Live Demo

Try hovering or clicking on the button â€” the ripple will follow your cursor and fade out with a subtle animation.
